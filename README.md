# Show container status and resource usage
./kvs-conversion-server.sh status

# View container logs
./kvs-conversion-server.sh logs
./kvs-conversion-server.sh logs -f  # Follow logs in real-time

# Start/stop/restart container
./kvs-conversion-server.sh start
./kvs-conversion-server.sh stop
./kvs-conversion-server.sh restart

# Display full configuration
./kvs-conversion-server.sh info

# Update to latest Docker image
./kvs-conversion-server.sh update

# Remove container and optionally data
./kvs-conversion-server.sh remove
```

**Command Aliases:**
- **status** / **ps**
- **start** / **up**
- **stop** / **down**
- **remove** / **rm**

## Compatibility

- **Docker Dependency**: This script requires **Docker** to be installed and functioning on your system. **Docker** provides the necessary isolation and environment consistency to run the conversion software reliably. The script will automatically check if **Docker** is installed on your system. If it is not found, you will be prompted to install **Docker** using the official installation script. *Please note that installing Docker may require virtualization to be enabled on your system and administrative (root) privileges to install the Docker package.*

- **System Architecture**: The script and its dependencies have been tested exclusively on amd64 architectures. Ensure your system complies with this specification to guarantee compatibility.

- **CPU Only Testing**: This script has been tested with **CPU**-based processing only. We have not conducted tests with dedicated or integrated **GPUs**. If you are interested in exploring **GPU**-accelerated processing for video conversion, please open an issue on our **GitHub** repository to discuss your requirements and potential enhancements.

### Hardware Recommendations

To ensure *optimal performance* of the video conversion server, the following hardware specifications are *recommended*:

**RAM**: At least **1GB** of **RAM** is *recommended*. *This is generally sufficient for handling the operational overhead of **Docker** and the basic video processing tasks.*
**CPU**: A faster **CPU** is crucial as video conversion is a **CPU**-intensive process. The speed and number of **CPU** cores will significantly influence the time required to process videos.
**Storage**: Sufficient storage space is necessary to accommodate the raw video files and the converted outputs. While an **HDD** is adequate for storage purposes, the processing capability primarily depends on the **CPU** power.

*Please consider these recommendations as guidelines which reflect the minimum setup required to efficiently use the script and perform video conversions.*
*The actual performance can vary based on the specific video formats and the conversion settings used.*

## Features

- **Automated KVS Setup**: Installs all necessary dependencies and configures cron jobs, tailored to meet the [**KVS** requirements](https://www.kernel-video-sharing.com/en/requirements/). For more details on video conversion engines and speeds, see [Video Conversion Engine and Speed](https://forum.kernel-video-sharing.com/topic/50-video-conversion-engine-and-video-conversion-speed/). To learn how to add a remote conversion server in **KVS**, visit [Adding a Remote Conversion Server in KVS](https://forum.kernel-video-sharing.com/topic/118-how-to-add-remote-conversion-server-in-kvs/).
- **Extended PHP Support**: Uses Sury's repository to provide extended **PHP** version support, incorporating security updates from [Freexian's Debian LTS project](https://www.freexian.com/lts/debian/).
- **Automated Updates**: Enables automatic updates for all installed packages and added repositories to keep the server *secure* and *up-to-date*.
- **Container Configuration**: Provides the capability to limit CPU usage for **Docker** containers. This feature allows users to set custom limits on CPU utilization, tailored to their system's capabilities.
- **FTPS Support**: Full **SSL/TLS** encryption support for **FTP** connections with automatic self-signed certificate generation. Supports both *explicit mode* (AUTH TLS on port **21**) and *implicit mode* (SSL from start on port **990**) for enhanced security during file transfers.

## To-Do

- **Optional IonCube Installation**: Make **IonCube** loader installation *optional* based on user needs. This will allow users who have the **KVS** open-source addon to skip **IonCube** installation, reducing image size and complexity, while still supporting **KVS** installations that require IonCube-encoded PHP files.

- **FFmpeg Version Selection**: Implement the option for users to select between different **FFmpeg** versions *(5.x LTS, 6.x, 7.x LTS, 8.x)* depending on their specific requirements for video processing capabilities and compatibility with various codecs and formats. *Currently, KVS doesn't seem to have any compatibility issues with newer FFmpeg versions.*

View the full project details and progress [here](https://github.com/users/MaximeMichaud/projects/3).

## Supports

The technologies used depend on what **KVS** supports, which means that some may not be the most up-to-date if **KVS** has not yet provided support for them. *(For example, **PHP 8.2/8.3** is not yet officially supported by KVS and thus not recommended.)*

- **VsFTPd** **3.0.5**
- **PHP** **7.4** *(for KVS < 6.2.0)* or **PHP** **8.1+** *(for KVS â‰¥ 6.2.0)* with sury.org and **IonCube**
- **FFmpeg** **7.1** *(LTS)*
- **ImageMagick** **7.x**

## Customization and Limitations

While this script is designed for a straightforward deployment, it may require adjustments based on your server's needs. Here are a few points to consider:

**Base Image**: The **Docker** image used in this script is based on **Debian 13 Slim**. This choice was made to balance flexibility and disk space usage. Although **Debian Slim** uses slightly more disk space compared to **Alpine**, it was selected over **Alpine** due to several key advantages:
  - **Compatibility Issues with Alpine**: **Alpine Linux** presented challenges that would have required additional configuration time and effort. Specifically, **Alpine** lacks support for certain libraries and tools needed for robust video processing.
  - **Support for Sury PHP**: **Debian** provides support for [sury.org](https://sury.org), a repository that offers updated **PHP** packages and patches for versions no longer officially supported by PHP.net. This is crucial for maintaining high security and compatibility standards in **PHP**-based applications, especially when dealing with video processing tasks where efficiency and reliability are paramount.

### Deployment Considerations / Scalability

- **Single Instance Recommended**: This script and the corresponding **Docker** image are not designed for operation across multiple instances simultaneously. To manage different workloads or multiple **KVS** installations, we *recommend* utilizing multiple directories *(one folder per project)* rather than deploying multiple instances of the **Docker** image. This approach helps avoid resource contention and simplifies management.
- **Network Requirements**: This image is optimized for use on open networks that are free of restrictive firewalls or filters. For environments within private networks or those subject to access restrictions, additional configuration steps may be required. *Solutions like **Tailscale** / **WireGuard** or similar private network services can be utilized to facilitate necessary connectivity and ensure full functionality of the system.*

These points should help you tailor the installation to your needs.
